CLYWmparison
==============

As a hobbyist modern-day yoyoer, there are 3 primary stats I look at when purchasing a new yoyo:

<ol>
  <li>- Diameter (in mm)</li>
  <li>- Width (in mm)</li>
  <li>- Weight (in g)</li>
</ol>

All of this information is available from the manufacturers, but there isn't any neat way to visualize that data. Until now.

<a href="http://www.clyw.ca">Caribou Lodge Yoyo Works</a>, CLYW for short, is a Canadian yoyo company that makes unbelievable high-end yoyos. I've decided to focus on their 25+ models for now, although this project could easily be expanded to include other manufacturers.


<h2>Development & Technology Details:</h2>

This is a <em>48-hour</em> weekend project. Hackathon-style.

I'm creating this project as an exercise in data visualization and testing. 
- For data visualization, I'll be using D3.js to create a radar chart.
- For testing, I'll be using Jasmine. I'm going to *attempt* to develop this using TDD (Test-Driven Development)
- To get some more JS practice, I will NOT be using jQuery. For sanity, I'll use Underscore.js, but I'll try and write some straight-up JavaScript here and there.

This is a purely front-end project, all done in JavaScript. In addition to D3 and Jasmine, I'll be using Underscore.js to aid with iteration.
